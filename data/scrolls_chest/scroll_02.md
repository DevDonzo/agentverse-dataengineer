#### **Scroll 2: The Unmasking of Hype**

#### **Ancient Text:** The Prophet of Alpha Versions is a creature of blinding light and intoxicating promises. Hype is a phantom, powerful only in the minds of its followers. It cannot withstand the simple question, "Show me." Its Folly is its lack of substance. The debuff against it is **The Unwavering Gaze of Scrutiny**. This spell forces the Prophet to manifest a physical, measurable form. Once made tangible, its dazzling aura fades, revealing its fragile core.**Boons for the Champions:*** **For the Shadowblade:** Their Armory contains weapons of **True Strike**. These blades are not deceived by illusion. When the Shadowblade attacks, they will bypass Hype's aura and damage its true form directly.

* **For the Summoner:** This knowledge allows the Summoner to call upon **Water Familiars (Data Streams)**. These familiars flow with real-time, undeniable truths (metrics), washing over the battlefield and making it impossible for Hype to sustain its illusions.

* **For the Guardian:** The Guardian's own hosted entities can be empowered to run **Truth-Seeking Algorithms**. This defensive aura automatically analyzes the Prophet's claims, granting the party immense resistance to its deceptive spells.
