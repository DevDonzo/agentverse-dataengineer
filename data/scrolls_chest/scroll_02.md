Beware the Hydra of Scope Creep. For every requirement you define, two more seem to appear in its place. It feeds on ambiguity and grows strong on the phrase 'while you're at it.' The champion's shield against this multi-headed menace is the 'Charter of Clarity.' This sacred pact, forged before the first line of code is written, defines the precise boundaries of the quest. It declares not only what will be done, but what will not be done. Any new head that emerges must be judged against the Charter. If it lies outside the pact, it is severed not with code, but with a decisive 'no.'
