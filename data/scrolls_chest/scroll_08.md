#### **Scroll 8: The Rebuke of Micromanagement**

#### **Ancient Text:** The Thousand-Eyed Watcher is a beholder-kin that hovers over the battlefield, its every eye fixated on a single champion. It does not attack, but "corrects." It bombards its target with a thousand tiny, distracting course-corrections, preventing them from ever finding their own rhythm. Its Folly is its divided focus; it cannot comprehend true autonomy. The debuff is **The Cloak of Trust**. This enchantment makes a champion's actions invisible to the Watcher, so long as their actions align with the party's overall goal. Robbed of its ability to meddle, the Watcher grows blind and powerless.**Boons for the Champions:*** **For the Shadowblade:** Grant them the buff of **Empowered Autonomy**. Their attacks do more damage the longer they fight without direct orders from the Scholar or Summoner.

* **For the Summoner:** The Summoner must learn to deploy **Fire-and-Forget Familiars**. These are summoned with a high-level objective and execute their tasks independently, their efficiency growing the less they are interfered with.

* **For the Guardian:** The Guardian can cast a **Shield of Delegation**, which absorbs the Watcher's distracting magical bolts, allowing the party to focus on their primary roles.
