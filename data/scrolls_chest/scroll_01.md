#### **Scroll 1: The Defeat of Procrastination**

**Ancient Text:** The beast known as Procrastination is a Slumbering Sloth, a timeless entity that whispers of infinite tomorrows. It does not attack with claws, but with the heavy, sweet scent of inaction, draining the very will to begin. Its Folly is its belief in the grand gesture; it is paralyzed by the small, immediate act. To defeat it, one must not plan a great assault. Instead, cast upon it **The Tyranny of the Now**, a debuff that shatters a great quest into a thousand tiny, undeniable steps. The beast, unable to comprehend the trivial, will falter.

**Boons for the Champions:**

- **For the Shadowblade:** This lore grants a **Haste** effect. Instruct the Shadowblade to strike with a flurry of small, rapid attacks. Their swiftness will overwhelm the Sloth before it can even rouse itself to defend.

- **For the Summoner:** The Summoner must forgo their great Earth Familiars. Instead, empower them to call upon a swarm of swift **Air Familiars (APIs)**, each executing a single, tiny task. The sheer volume of concurrent actions will unravel the monster's torpor.

- **For the Guardian:** The Guardian may cast a **Shield of Focus** upon the party. This ward deflects the beast's soporific whispers, preventing the party's momentum from being drained.
