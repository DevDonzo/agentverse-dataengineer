The beast known as Procrastination is a subtle thief. It does not attack with fang or claw, but with the sweet poison of 'later.' It whispers that the task is large, the path is uncertain, and that clarity will surely come with the next dawn. To defeat it, one must not seek a grand plan, but the smallest, most elegant first step. This is the principle of 'Elegant Sufficiency' - finding the one, simple action that can be completed now. This single act breaks the creature's spell and builds the momentum needed for the larger quest. Do not wait for perfect knowledge; strike with what you have.
