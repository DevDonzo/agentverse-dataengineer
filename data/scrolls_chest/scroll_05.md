#### **Scroll 5: The Escape from Perfectionism**

#### **Ancient Text:** The Gilded Cage is an angelic entity that bleeds radiance, promising a flawless, ultimate creation. It does not attack, but traps. It ensnares its victims in a loop of infinite refinement, whispering that "one more change" will achieve perfection. Its Folly is its ignorance of value. It cannot be defeated by force, but by a declaration of **Elegant Sufficiency**. This debuff defines a clear, achievable "good enough" state, making the Cage's promises of unattainable perfection lose their power.**Boons for the Champions:*** **For the Shadowblade:** Their buff is **Decisive Strike**. They must commit to a single attack pattern and execute it. Hesitation or changing the plan mid-swing will restore the monster's power.

* **For the Summoner:** The Summoner must be empowered to deploy their Familiars on a strict, unchangeable schedule. Reducing the cooldown of their **Air Familiars (APIs)** allows for rapid, iterative deployments, proving that value comes from shipping, not perfecting.

* **For the Guardian:** The Guardian can recover the party's Mana (MP) by casting **The Spell of Finite Resources**. This reminds the party that their energy is not infinite and must be spent on what is valuable, not what is perfect.
