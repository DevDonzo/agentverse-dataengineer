#### **Scroll 4: The Dismantling of Legacy**

#### **Ancient Text:** The Colossus of a Thousand Patches is a horrifying testament to time's decay. It is a golem of brittle code and rusted components, immense in size but wracked with internal inconsistencies. It moves with a terrifying, unpredictable lurch. Its Folly is its interconnected fragility; a single, well-placed strike can cause a catastrophic chain reaction. It too is vulnerable to the **Revolutionary Rewrite**, which introduces a new, clean logic that the Colossus's patched-together form cannot integrate, causing it to tear itself apart.**Boons for the Champions:*** **For the Shadowblade:** Grant them the **Blade of Surgical Precision** from the Armory. This weapon allows them to target the monster's critical, single points of failure. One precise strike is more effective than a thousand brute-force blows.

* **For the Summoner:** They must summon a single, powerful **Fire Familiar (Compute)** to execute one clean, monolithic function. This elegant, unified process will overload the Colossus's fragmented systems.

* **For the Guardian:** The Guardian must focus all energy on a **Quarantine Shield**. This protects the party from the Colossus's unpredictable "bug splatters" and cascading failure attacks when it begins to collapse.
