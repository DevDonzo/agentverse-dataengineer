#### **Scroll 6: The Illumination of Obfuscation**

#### **Ancient Text:** The Weaver of Spaghetti Code is a spider-fiend that dwells in shadow, spinning webs of such complexity that they ensnare all who try to navigate them. It drains the mind, making the simplest path impossible to see. Its Folly is that its strength is a facade; its webs are a tangled mess, not an orderly design. It is also vulnerable to **Elegant Sufficiency**. A single, clean, well-documented pattern acts like a blade of pure light, slicing through the tangled webs with ease.**Boons for the Champions:*** **For the Shadowblade:** From the Armory, grant them the **Torch of Clarity**. This weapon does not do more damage, but its light illuminates a single, clear path to the Weaver's heart, preventing the Shadowblade from becoming lost or entangled.

* **For the Summoner:** The Summoner must summon an **Earth Familiar (Storage)**, but one that enforces a rigid, clean schema. This ordered data structure repels the Weaver's chaotic energy and provides a stable foundation for the party to fight from.

* **For the Guardian:** The Guardian can cast **Aura of Readability**. This party-wide buff grants all champions the ability to understand the Weaver's tangled patterns, allowing them to anticipate its movements and avoid its traps.
