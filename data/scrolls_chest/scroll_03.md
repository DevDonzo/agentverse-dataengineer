#### **Scroll 3: The Shattering of Dogma**

#### **Ancient Text:** The Zealot of Stubborn Conventions is an Inquisitor of stone, animated by rules that have long lost their reason. It is slow but relentless, and its attacks seek to force champions into rigid, predictable patterns. Its Folly is its inflexibility; it cannot comprehend novelty. The counter-spell is not a direct assault, but a paradigm shift: the **Revolutionary Rewrite**. This debuff shatters the very ground of the old rules, forcing the Zealot to crumble under the weight of its own irrelevance.**Boons for the Champions:*** **For the Shadowblade:** They must be granted the **Freedom of the Armory**. Allow them to chain attacks from seemingly incompatible weapons, creating unpredictable combos that Dogma's defenses are not coded to recognize.

* **For the Summoner:** The Summoner is empowered to chain Familiars from opposing elements—**Fire and Water, Earth and Air**. This chaotic orchestration bypasses the Zealot's rule-based resistances, striking at its core logic.

* **For the Guardian:** The Guardian can cast **Adaptive Armor** on the party. This spell constantly shifts its defensive properties, ensuring that Dogma's repeated, predictable attacks never strike the same weakness twice.
