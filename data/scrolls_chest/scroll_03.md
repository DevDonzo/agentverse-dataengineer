The Rust Demon of Technical Debt is the ghost of past haste. It is born from shortcuts taken and foundations laid in a hurry. It does not sleep. In the darkness, it silently corrodes your stronghold, turning sturdy pillars of code into brittle rust. A direct assault is often folly, for its decay is widespread. The only weapon it fears is the 'Tithe of Refactoring.' This is a solemn vow to pay a small, regular tribute of time to strengthen and cleanse the old foundations. By consistently replacing a rusted brick here or polishing a tarnished gear there, the Demon is starved. It cannot thrive where craftsmanship is a living, ongoing practice, not a relic of the past.
