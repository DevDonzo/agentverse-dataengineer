#### **Scroll 7: The Rally against Apathy**

#### **Ancient Text:** The Spectre of "It Works on My Machine" is a ghost that haunts the spaces between champions. It is a creature of indifference, feeding on dissolved responsibility and fractured teamwork. It does not attack directly but drains passion, making victory feel meaningless. Its Folly is its reliance on isolation. It cannot survive in an environment of shared understanding. The debuff is **Unbroken Collaboration**. This spell creates a psychic link between all party members, forcing the Spectre into a single, vulnerable form.**Boons for the Champions:*** **For the Shadowblade:** Their Armory access must be shared. Empower the Summoner to remotely call upon the Shadowblade's weapons, fostering a dependency that strengthens them both and harms the Spectre.

* **For the Summoner:** The Summoner's Familiars must be summoned with **Shared State**. When the Fire Familiar attacks, the Water Familiar knows. This interconnectedness creates a unified front that the Spectre cannot phase through.

* **For the Guardian:** The Guardian must cast **Centralized Wellspring**. Instead of healing individuals, this spell creates a single pool of HP and MP that all party members draw from and contribute to, reinforcing that their survival is a shared responsibility.
