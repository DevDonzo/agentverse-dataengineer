Scroll Fragment -- Log Entry br_735:A new trial emerged from the static. Subject: Boric, a Shadowblade of blinding speed, designation adv_002. His target was the Spectre of Obfuscation ('ob-02'), a chittering horror of tangled code with a formidable 250 Hit Points. Boric became a blur, his twin strikes landing with precision. The first blow dealt 180 damage, the second 170. The web of confusion was severed in 300 seconds. Final Assessment: Victory.
