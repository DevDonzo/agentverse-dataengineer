croll Fragment -- Log Entry br_736:An ominous presence was detected near the Grand Orrery. The Summoner, a wielder of immense power known as Lyra (adv_003), faced the colossal Spectre of Legacy ('lg-01'). This gargantuan entity, a mismatched chimera of old code, pulsed with 400 Hit Points. Lyra initiated her grand summoning. The resulting blast of raw energy was overwhelming, inflicting 450 points of damage and disintegrating the Spectre in a climactic 90-second battle. Final Assessment: Victory.
